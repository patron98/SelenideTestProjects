---->4.What is Backtick?
Backticks are an ES6 feature that allows you to create strings in JavaScript. 
Although backticks are mostly used for HTML or code embedding purposes, they also act similar to single and double quotes. 
Besides, using backticks makes it easier for string operations.
---->5.What is axios api?
Axios: Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from node. js or XMLHttpRequests from the browser and it supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6. 
It can be used intercept HTTP requests and responses and enables client-side protection against XSRF. 
It also has the ability to cancel requests.
Different properties are used for a post request to send data to the endpoint - Axios uses the data property, whereas with fetch we use the body property. 
We need to serialize data into a JSON string to send data. 
Axios automatically stringifies data when sending JavaScript objects to the API using the POST method.


Example::
.post("employee/login?employeeName="+email+"&password="+pass)--->Post
.get("employee/login?employeeName=""&password=")--->Get
